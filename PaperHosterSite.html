        Welcome to a crappy Website!
    </h1>
    <h3>
        Cause Asad did not get enough time to put up the graphics of this webiste
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Also has Asad creepily asked you for your email?
    </p>


    
    <p>
        Well you are in luck (or maybe not...)
    </p>
    <p>
        So here is a rough Idea of what is happening
    </p>
    <p>
         This is going to be a network of Students from different colleges sharing there notes and exam papers
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything will be hosted by a central drive where all the files are supposed tp be uploaded! 
        <br>
        You are wondering how? 
        <br>
        Well you Dumbass you have to upload them...
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain people from every college will be given editing access of the folder of their college
        <br>
        If you are seeing this then that means you will be getting editting access of your college!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence you are Officially an Editor Node!!!
        <br>
        Rest of the inferior beings will be just Nodes ((Feel the Supremecy))
    </p>
    <p>
        Although for now I do request you all to not share the Drive link to anyone cause I have no idea how stable doing this actually is...
    </p>
    
    <!-- Drive storage explaination -->
    <div class = "Lefties">
    <p>
        Every College Folder is in a specific order to have every file is supposed to be in the most predictable positon
        <br>
        <br>
        Most Folder stacks go in the following order:
        <br>
        [College Name] <br>↳ [Semester] <br>&nbsp↳ [The Exam/The Notes] <br>&nbsp &nbsp↳ [Subject] <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp↳ [From here its upto the Editor Node]
        <br>
        VIT Chennai and VIT Vellore have been already filled as an example
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        But if your College is as weird and dumb as you, then you are welcome to change the format or you can even
    </p>
    <p>
        Plus you can give feedback on changing any structure 
        <br>
        (Cause you know I am wrting this at 3 a.m. God knows why... wait does he even know why???)
    </p>
